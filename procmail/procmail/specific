# Procmail rules for specific folders

# This is for messages I get regularly about a specific topic, but that aren't
# alert emails or from a mailing list.  This takes effect before the priority
# system and before the mailing list filter, so this might hijack messages that
# would otherwise go to a mailing list folder.  I consider that OK.

# All logwatch messages go to same folder
# Some machines send me logwatch directly

# Monitor <no-reply@opensciencegrid.org>" with "[logwatch]" in the
# subject.
