# Decode MIME Messages
###############################################################################

# Many of my procmail rules won't work or will produce garbled results
# if the message is encoded via MIME's base64 or quoted-printable
# schemes.  The rules in this file should run before others; they
# should decode email bodies encoded via one of those two schemes
# without affecting attachments.  I hope.

# This is taken straight from "man 5 procmailex", with the exception
# that mimencode, which is used in that man page, isn't distributed
# with RHEL, nor is it found in any package on EPEL, so we have to
# make do.

# This won't affect messages with attachments, because with those the
# header's Content-Type will be "multipart/*".  This won't pick up on
# Content-Type headers in attachment sections because those aren't
# part of the main mail header.  Encoded attachments won't be touched.
# In other words, this rule will only affect messages without
# attachments that are type "text/plain" with
# "Content-Transfer-Encoding" set to either "base64" or
# "quoted-printable".

  # If the main message has a "Content-Transfer-Encoding" header field
  # indicating that it is "quoted-printable", filter the body through
  # this decoding command and wait for it to complete.

  :0fbw
  * ^Content-Transfer-Encoding: *quoted-printable
  | perl -p -e 'BEGIN { use MIME::QuotedPrint; } $_ = decode_qp($_);'

  # If the previous rule happened, regardless of return value, filter
  # the header through this command to change the encoding type to
  # "8bit".

  :0Afhw
  | formail -I "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit"

  # Likewise, if the encoding is "base64", filter the body through
  # this command to decode it.

  :0fbw
  * ^Content-Transfer-Encoding: *base64
  | openssl base64 -d

  # Likewise, if the previous command happened, filter the header
  # through this command to change the encoding type to "8bit".
