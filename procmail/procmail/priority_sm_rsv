# service-monitor RSV
###############################################################################

# This is a procmailrc file, part of my priority system.  It's a bit different
# from the usual ones, though, because this is for messages that come from
# Soichi's service-monitor script that have alerts from more than one host in
# them at the same time.  I'd like to handle these separately, but Procmail
# doesn't have a normal way to handle this sort of thing, so I'm going to write
# a Perl script that splits the body up and creates multiple emails with the
# same header (varying the Message-Id, however), running them through Procmail
# again so each one gets processed separately.

# The hallmarks of such emails are:

# From: "monitor.grid.iu.edu" <goc@opensciencegrid.org>
# Subject: [rsvtest] Problem with central services

# The body will have one or more lines that look like:

# > Mon 03/25/13 11:15:02 : OSG_Display_1 RSV status is CRITICAL : display1.grid.iu.edu

# Note that these emails are in MIME Quoted-Printable format, meaning that
# lines are truncated at 76 characters and terminated with '=' as a
# continuation mark and that '=' is escaped as '=3D'.  Procmail doesn't handle
# this format well, but Perl's MIME::Tools module does.

# The string "OSG_Display_1" is defined in the RSV probe and may actually
# contain spaces.

# The goal here is to pipe the message to a Perl script in a terminating
# fashion -- there's no expectation that we'll return from this, because the
# message will be split into multiple messages that will each then go through
# Procmail separately.

# Then, after the emails have gone through the Perl script and been divided and
# run back through Procmail, this script sets the PRI_ variables for it, where
# it then gets processed by priority_services.

# First make sure nothing's set PRI_CLASS to anything
:0
* ! PRI_CLASS ?? .+
{
  # Second, to prevent the script from seeing the message again, it will set a
  # header, 'X-TJL-Pri-SM-RSV-Seen' (its value is unimportant; it is its
  # presence that is telling)
