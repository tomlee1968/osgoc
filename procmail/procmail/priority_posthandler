# priority_posthandler
# Adjust priority (usually downward) based on hostname, service, etc.

# It's often the case that software considers its problems to be VERY IMPORTANT
# and anything that goes wrong to be world-shaking, demanding attention RIGHT
# NOW.  We at OSG Operations, however, have a bigger picture to consider, and
# some of these problems have to take a back seat to others.

# Most of the software we use isn't developed here and is still in beta or
# otherwise active development somewhere else.  The programmers of that
# software may have included some extra-noisy error messages or unsuppressable
# debug messages to tell them when something's going on, but frankly, we don't
# care.  These messages often end up as root emails, and we want them out of
# the way so we can see the truly critical messages that we can actually do
# something about.

# Also, some of our machines are development or testing machines, and messages
# from those, while valuable for debugging, simply can't take priority over
# errors coming from production services.  What would be a critical error on
# the production version of a service becomes noncritical on the ITB version.

# What's more, this is MY set of procmail config files, not everyone's.  If a
# service is reporting critical errors, but it's not a service that I work with
# or know what to do with, the error is frankly going to be of a lower priority
# for me than it would be for someone else.
