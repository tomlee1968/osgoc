# osgoc
Code from OSG Operations Center

This is a repository of code of various types that Tom Lee was entirely or largely reponsible for creating for the OSG Operations Center. Mostly this exists so Tom can use it for later reference: "How did I get this to work again?..." But as a public Github repository, it could also potentially be useful to others.
