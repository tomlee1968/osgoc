vmtool -- GOC VM utility

This is a script that does various frequently-required tasks with VMs.  The
script is not intended to be run as 'vmtool' but rather as 'mkvm', 'lsvm',
etc., which are symlinks that point to vmtool.  By default the script and
symlinks are installed in /opt/sbin, and the configuration file vmtool.conf is
in /opt/etc.

The Makefile and vmtool.spec file are fairly readable, so I suggest reading
them.  Basic things you might want to do:

$ make rpm -- makes installable source and "binary" RPMs of vmtool.
$ make clean -- deletes the tarball and any backup files left lying around.
# make install -- installs the script and config file and makes the symlinks
  (does not update the RPM database, so use with extreme caution)
$ make tarball -- makes a tarball of the directory's contents.

Making changes to this without knowing exactly what you're doing are not
recommended and could lead to virtual machines being corrupted or deleted.
Please be extremely careful.

If you change vmtool and wish to "release" it to the VM servers, please
increment the version in vmtool.spec.  Also, please make note of your changes
in the changelog in vmtool.spec.

Above all, whatever you think of RPM, please do not unilaterally decide you're
going to stop using RPM to distribute this.  Our servers are all Redhat, which
means that it's often useful to work within Redhat's software packaging system.
(You can always look up the current version with "rpm -qi vmtool", for one
thing.)  Altering and/or deleting files that are controlled by the RPM system
can corrupt the RPM database, causing all sorts of trouble later (imagine an
update that should have taken 5 minutes taking all day instead).  If you really
can't stand RPM and want to install via the Makefile every time, please remove
the RPM from the database first ("rpm -e vmtool").
