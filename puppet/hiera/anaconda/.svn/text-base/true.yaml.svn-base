# Rules for building systems of any kind
#
# The only time anything in this file will take effect is when Puppet is run
# during the postinstall section of an Anaconda kickstart file that we use at
# the OSG Operations Center -- our kickstart files add a custom Facter fact
# called 'anaconda' that returns true at the start of the postinstall section
# and delete it at the end.  This is nonstandard behavior, but we always do it
# here, so we can rely on it here at the Operations Center, though other people
# at other places probably shouldn't rely on it (unless they set up something
# similar).  This file is for classes and parameters that only affect systems
# that are in the process of being built.  There are only two kinds of those:
# physical systems and stemcell images.  In either case they use the
# interjection.uits.indiana.edu/interjection.goc IP address(es) and Puppet
# certificate to connect to Puppet and run it before the postinstall procedure
# is done.  I'm trying to reduce the amount of stuff that happens in the
# postinstall script(s) and move more of it here, for two reasons:
#
# 1. The Cobbler build process will require less customization -- Puppet will
# do all of that.  The kickstart files will therefore be much simpler and more
# similar between distros than they are now, focusing as they will on just
# getting the system ready to run Puppet and then running it.
#
# 2. Instead of shuffling changes from Puppet to Cobbler, as when something
# must be changed on every existing host and then on all future new hosts via
# stemcell, we'll only have to move things from global Puppet to Anaconda-only
# Puppet.

# Some rules should only affect RHEL 5 systems and will be found in
# hiera/anaconda/true/RedHat/5.yaml.  Likewise, there are 6.yaml and 7.yaml
# files in that directory for RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7 distros.  This file, though,
# is for rules meant to affect all of those.

# Keep in mind that the postinstall script takes place in the Anaconda
# postinstall environment, which means that the system is running on one kernel
# but is chrooted to the '/' directory of a system that contains another kernel
# and its modules on disk.  Don't expect any commands that load modules to work
# properly or without error messages.  Also, on any distro that uses systemd
# (such as RHEL/CentOS 7 or later), attempting to start any service will fail
# in the Anaconda postinstall environment, as systemd adamantly refuses to
# start services under chroot.  It can enable/disable services, however.  Some
# services can still be started with an exec command, but others cannot
# (e.g. 'messagebus' refuses to start because it can't find systemd's socket in
# the filesystem, and therefore 'sssd' refuses to start because it can't run
# without messagebus).

# Augeas rules for the Hiera module to create during system install.  For those
# who don't know about Augeas already, it is capable of making single changes
# within standard config files without changing anything else, but only if
# someone has written an Augeas "lens" (definition file) for that configuration
# file.  Most standard Linux configuration files have Augeas lenses, but of
# course some don't.  You can use the 'augtool' command to test Augeas and its
# lenses.

# Packages to make sure are installed (or not) during system install.
#
# Where possible, package inclusion and exclusion should be handled by the
# Cobbler/Anaconda kickstart file's package list -- it's just faster and
# easier.  There are, however, still reasons why we'd need to include/exclude
# packages here:
#
# * Package availability: The package is only available later in the install
#   process; for example, it might be in a repository whose .repo file isn't
#   installed until the postinstall script (perhaps Puppet installs it), so we
#   install it here, with a dependency on that .repo file.
#
# * Anaconda uncooperative: Sometimes, despite explicitly being told otherwise
#   in the kickstart file's package list, Anaconda stubbornly refuses to
#   install or not install a package for mysterious reasons, so we install or
#   remove it here.
#
# * Needed only for Anaconda (rare): The package is necessary for Anaconda but
#   is no longer needed once the installation process has reached the
#   postinstall script, or in fact ever again, so we remove it here.
#
# Note that there is no point in "ensure: latest" for any of these; these rules
# won't be run again after system install.

# Services to make sure are enabled (or disabled) during system install.

# Usually you should do this in the kickstart file and not here, but sometimes
# Anaconda stubbornly refuses to enable or disable a service, even if you tell
# it explicitly to do so in the kickstart file, so you have to handle it
# manually in the postinstall stage (like here, for example).

# Note that actually attempting to start them during system install is usually
# a bad idea (hence the "ensure: undef") -- sometimes even if you need them
# during system install.  You will probably have to do something special and
# likely distro-dependent in the kickstart file (or here).
