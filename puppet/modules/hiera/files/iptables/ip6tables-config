# This file is sourced by the Red Hat ip6tables initscript
# (/etc/rc.d/init.d/ip6tables).  Normally this file would contain
# settings for that initscript, but at the GOC we don't use that; we
# use the "gociptables" initscript instead, which implements a simple
# but more flexible method of invoking every executable script in
# /etc/iptables.d.  However, there are many who are finding it
# difficult to break the habit of automatically typing "service
# ip6tables restart," so I replaced the old ip6tables-config with this
# file, which will effectively disable the Red Hat initscript.

# FAQ #1: Why don't we just delete the Red Hat ip6tables initscript?
# A: It's part of the "ip6tables" RPM; next time Red Hat sent out an
# update of that RPM, it would just come back.

# FAQ #2: Why don't we just remove the "ip6tables" RPM?
# A: It also contains the ip6tables utility, without which we couldn't
# have an IPv6 firewall at all.

# FAQ #3: Why does Red Hat package the ip6tables utility (a standard
# Linux utility) together with its own ip6tables initscript?
# A: Why does Red Hat do anything they do?  I can't explain their
# decisions.

# FAQ #4: Why don't we just replace the Red Hat ip6tables initscript
# with a symlink to the gociptables one?
# A: There's a good chance that, next time Red Hat sent out an update
# to the ip6tables package, it would either choke because the target of
# one of its files was now a symlink, or replace the target of the
# symlink (gociptables) with the ip6tables initscript.

# FAQ #5: Why don't we just replace the Red Hat ip6tables initscript
# with a script that prints a message saying to use gociptables?
# A: See FAQ #1.  Next time the ip6tables RPM got an update, that
# change would be wiped out.  But this is a viable alternative -- RPM
# updates don't change config files.

echo "Red Hat ip6tables initscript disabled."
echo "Please use gociptables initscript instead."
