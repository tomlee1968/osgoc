OSG OPERATIONS CENTER STANDARD LOCATIONS FOR CERTIFICATE FILES
==============================================================

There has been much confusion about how the /etc/grid-security directory is
supposed to work, so this README file is here to clarify.  It doesn't help that
some OSG software is incompatible with the standard layout, leading some to
assume that the way software package X, Y, or Z does it is the standard
instead.  The standard described in this file isn't superior to any other, but
it is the one that the OSG Operations Center discussed and agreed on back in
2008, and it should be followed when possible until the Operations Center
collectively decides that it needs to be changed (at which point this document
will be changed to match).

That "when possible" is important -- as mentioned already, some software has
hardcoded locations where it expects to find certificates.  And in some cases a
host must have multiple host certificates from different CAs at the same time,
or other situations that preclude strict adherence to this standard.  Do what
you can.

Why set a standard?  So we can write scripts that look for certificates in
specific directories and with specific filenames.  Unlike other types of data
(images, source code, etc.), there's no standard file extension for
certificates and no general way to tell whether a file contains a certificate.
It's up to a given site to make these decisions for systems under their
control, and that's what we've done here.  Failure to follow the standard
generally means that scripts will ignore your certificates -- so if you're
expecting a script to warn you when your certificate is expiring soon, either
follow this standard or you're out of luck.

===============================================================================
RULE 1: All OSG-related certificates and their private keys should be found
under the directory /etc/grid-security.
===============================================================================

This is fairly simple -- every machine will have that directory, and scripts
can always count on finding the certificates they're looking for within it.

===============================================================================
RULE 2: All of a host's certificates should be in PEM-encoded DER format and
should be called cert.pem.
===============================================================================

Scripts that look for certificates (to send out warnings when they're going to
expire, for example) are much easier to write when those certificates have a
known filename.  Because multiple formats exist for storing certificates, it's
often difficult to recognize a file containing a certificate, so we need to
specify a preferred format and filename.  If more than one certificate exists
on the same machine, they can exist within separate subdirectories of
/etc/grid-security.  For more about those subdirectories, read on.

===============================================================================
RULE 3: Certificates' private keys should also be in PEM-encoded DER format and
should be stored unencrypted, with filename key.pem, in the same directory as
their related cert.pem.  These keys should never be world readable.
===============================================================================

It's not as secure as it could be, strictly speaking, to store private keys
unencrypted, but software that needs to read keys can't do so if they're
encrypted (without either requiring a sysadmin to physically type in a
passphrase whenever the service restarts, which is unscalable, or having the
passphrase in a file somewhere, which is just shifting the problem around).
The Operations Center doesn't give shell access to the public, though, so there
are only a limited number of users who could conceivably see the keys, and if
they're not set world readable, that limits who can see them even further.

===============================================================================
RULE 4: The /etc/grid-security/certificates directory contains OSG CA
certificates and their CRLs.
===============================================================================

These are maintained by the RPM packages 'osg-ca-certs' and 'goc-crls'.

===============================================================================
RULE 5: The host certificate and its private key should be found in the
directory /etc/grid-security/host.
===============================================================================

That is, the host certificate will be /etc/grid-security/host/cert.pem, and its
private key key.pem.

===============================================================================
RULE 6: Service certificates should be found in relevant directories named
after their services.  They should be named cert.pem and key.pem, just like all
others.  Host certificates should not go into such directories; they should be
in 'host'.
===============================================================================

If you don't know what a service certificate is, see NOTE ON SERVICE
CERTIFICATES below.  If the machine has a service certificate for a service
named <serviceid>, there should be an /etc/grid-security/<serviceid> directory,
and the certificate and its key will be cert.pem and key.pem within it.  For
example, an http service certificate would be in
/etc/grid-security/http/cert.pem, and its key would be key.pem within the same
directory.

Note that the http directory is NOT for just anything related to http, and a
certificate does not become an 'http service certificate' just because it is
used for http.

===============================================================================
RULE 7: The GOC user certificate and its key should be in
/etc/grid-security/user.
===============================================================================

This is a *user* certificate rather than a host or service cert.  The
Operations Center uses this certificate to sign email it sends out.  Multiple
systems use it, so it is found on all systems.  It is maintained by Puppet, so
putting anything else in /etc/grid-security/user/cert.pem (and key.pem) will be
overwritten.  Best leave it alone.

===============================================================================
RULE 8: Other optional directories may exist within /etc/grid-security, but if
they contain certificates/keys, those should be still called cert.pem/key.pem.
Other sorts of files may have other names.
===============================================================================

For example, systems with an InCommon host certificate will also have
/etc/grid-security/intermediate/incommon.pem.  This contains the intermediate
CA chain certificates for InCommon.

===============================================================================
COMMON DEVIATIONS FROM THIS STANDARD
===============================================================================

These are frequently seen but should be avoided on new installations where
possible.  If you're reading this on a machine that has one of these cases,
either there was some OSG software that required the deviation from the
standard, or whoever set it up didn't do it right for one reason or another.
It is NOT normal.  Don't do these if you can help it.

* Host certificate and key in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem and hostkey.pem
  (put them in /etc/grid-security/host/cert.pem and key.pem)

* Http service certificate and key in /etc/grid-security/httpcert.pem and
  httpkey.pem (put them in /etc/grid-security/http/cert.pem and key.pem)

* Http service certificate and key in /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem and
  httpkey.pem (this is redundant; just name them cert.pem and key.pem) -- this
  goes for similar redundancies in service certificates such as
  /etc/grid-security/rsv/rsvcert.pem and rsvkey.pem, etc.

* Host certificate and key in /etc/grid-security/http/cert.pem and key.pem
  (they go in /etc/grid-security/host, regardless of whether Apache uses them
  or something else does)

===============================================================================
NOTE ON SERVICE CERTIFICATES:
===============================================================================

A 'service certificate' is a special type of certificate that differentiates
between different services on the same host.  They are usually not necessary
and are just this side of deprecated, but some OSG software still requires
them.  A host certificate is sufficient for most purposes.

The difference between a host certificate and a service certificate is simple:
in a host certificate, the CN contains only the hostname, while in a service
certificate, it contains the service and the hostname.  For example:

host certificate for www.grid.iu.edu: CN=www.grid.iu.edu
http service certificate for www.grid.iu.edu: CN=http/www.grid.iu.edu
