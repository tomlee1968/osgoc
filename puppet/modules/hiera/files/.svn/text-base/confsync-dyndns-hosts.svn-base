# Hosts file for confsync-dyndns

# Each line consists of a DNS entry and the name of an iptables subchain.  All
# rules in the subchain will be removed and replaced with a rule that permits
# packets coming from the given DNS entry's IP address.  The subchain must
# already exist -- create it in the firewall configuration files -- and
# remember that if the subchain isn't referred to anywhere, confsync-dyndns
# will have no effect.
