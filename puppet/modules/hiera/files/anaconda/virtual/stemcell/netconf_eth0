# below, this file has not been modified since the stemcell image was
# installed.  This is bad.  Run an install script as soon as possible, or it
# will not be possible for another VM to run using these IPs as long as this
# one is using them.  Continuing to use the stemcell IP addresses may prevent
# others from creating VMs from stemcell images.
