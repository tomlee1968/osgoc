# Configure Dell remote access, whether (i)DRAC or just BMC

# Things we need:

# Enable the remote module
# Enable the remote module for IPMI
# Set the remote module to share the NIC
# Set the remote module's IP address and subnet
# Set the remote module's root password

# We should gather information using omreport first and determine whether or
# not the change needs to be made before making it, because it takes several
# seconds to make any changes. We should also try to combine changes onto as
# few omconfig command lines as possible, or this script will take a long time
# (I'm still talking about less than a minute, though) to run.

# It is possible to use the racadm command to make these changes too, but only
# if there is an (i)DRAC controller present, and we tend not to order our
# machines with those. However, all Dell machines have at least a BMC, and the
# omconfig/omreport commands can configure both BMC and DRAC.

# Bash versions < 4 don't have associative arrays; the upshot is that RHEL 5
# machines must be dealt with manually (fortunately we have few of those
# remaining).
