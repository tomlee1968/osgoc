## goc_configure_sudo (postinstall)
## Configures sudo

## This places the following settings in /etc/sudoers after the
## "Defaults requiretty" line:

## lecture: The first time a given user runs sudo on this host, they
## will get the "with great power comes great responsibility" lecture
## from Uncle Ben.

## insults: Insults users who sudo and then enter a bad password.
## Actually I don't know what this is supposed to display, because no
## matter whether this is set or not, it just says, "Sorry, bad
## password" or the like.  I think Red Hat censored it.

## authenticate: This is on by default, but it means that unless an
## individual user or group is otherwise configured, a user must
## authenticate via a password (or some other means) in order to use
## sudo.

## It also replaces the commented out line granting access to the
## "wheel" group with an uncommented line granding root access to
## everyone in the "sudoers" group, which is in LDAP and is thus
## subnet-wide, but a password is required.

# Configure sudo
