## goc_fix_libguestfs
## Postinstall snippet

## The libguestfs package brings in a dependency called zfs-fuse,
## which has an initscript, but doesn't actually start the service or
## set it to automatically run at boot -- which is good, because
## libguestfs doesn't need zfs-fuse to be running in order to access
## the contents of a virtual disk.  However, zfs-fuse brings in an
## /etc/cron.weekly job that does some cleanup on ZFS volumes, but
## this job results in error email to root when the zfs-fuse service
## isn't running.  To shut this up, we must edit
## /etc/sysconfig/zfs-fuse and set ZFS_WEEKLY_SCRUB to "no", disabling
## this sloppily-written weekly cleanup that runs without checking to
## see whether the service is active.

if [[ -e /etc/sysconfig/zfs-fuse ]] && grep -Eq "^[[:space:]]*ZFS_WEEKLY_SCRUB=yes" /etc/sysconfig/zfs-fuse; then
    sed -i -re "s/^([[:space:]]*)ZFS_WEEKLY_SCRUB=.*$/\ZFS_WEEKLY_SCRUB=no/" /etc/sysconfig/zfs-fuse
