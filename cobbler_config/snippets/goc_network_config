## Unlike the standard Cobbler network_config snippet, this will work
## with the GOC setup.  What is the GOC setup, you may ask?
##
## First of all, there are two network interfaces.  These are called
## eth0 and eth1 if there isn't CNDN, or em1 and em2 if CNDN is in
## play.  CNDN stands for Consistent Network Device Naming and is a
## way for the BIOS to suggest standard names for the network
## interfaces in such a way that the same interfaces always get the
## same names.  In order for CNDN to happen, though, the BIOS must be
## talking, and the kernel must be listening.  RHEL 6.1 and later
## support it, and Dell PowerEdge servers of the R series with a
## nonzero penultimate digit (R515, R620, etc., but not R505) also
## support it.  However, the virtual BIOS of a qemu VM does not.
##
## At any rate, the presence of CNDN is not detected by these
## snippets; it is found in system records -- the variable $cndn will
## be true or false.  The goc_preamble snippet sets the variables if01
## and if02 to the two interfaces.
##
## Second, the first interface is on the public VLAN (259, with IPv4
## range 129.79.53.0/24 and IPv6 range 2001:18e8:2:6::/64) while the
## second is on the private VLAN (4020, unrouted, so we've assigned
## IPv4 range 192.168.96.0/22 and IPV6 range fd2f:6feb:37::/48).
##
## The PXE booting and DHCP dynamic addressing is done via the second
## interface, $if02, rather than the first.  All permanent GOC hosts
## have static IPs on both networks.  There is a public IP, with
## hostname interjection.uits.indiana.edu, for installing systems
## before they have been configured with their final static IPs.

#set stemcell=$getVar('stemcell', '')

#if $stemcell
  ## The goc_pinc snippet will already have written this:
%include /tmp/pre_install_network_config
#else
  $SNIPPET("network_config")
#end if
