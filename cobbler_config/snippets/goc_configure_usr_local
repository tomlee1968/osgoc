echo "Configuring /etc/fstab to mount /usr/local correctly ..."

# When installing RHEL 6, Anaconda sets up /etc/fstab to mount
# /usr/local by UUID.  Normally this is all well and good, but
# obviously this won't work for stemcells, because whenever we make a
# new VM we create a new disk image with a new UUID.  This is one
# situation where mounting by label works best.  Change /etc/fstab to
# mount /usr/local by label (the label will always be "/usr/local",
# because I've written the scripts that create the volume to always
# give it that label).

# This sed command edits /etc/fstab, leaving a backup file at
# /etc/fstab~, and what it does is search for the line that mounts a
# volume at /usr/local, replacing its device specifier with
# "LABEL=/usr/local" and leaving everything else on the line alone.

sed -i -re '/^[^[:space:]]+[[:space:]]+\/usr\/local[[:space:]]/s/^[^[:space:]]+([[:space:]]+.*)$/LABEL=\/usr\/local\1/' /etc/fstab
