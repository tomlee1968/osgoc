## goc_fix_initscripts (postinstall)
## Fixes up initscripts as we need them

## There is a bug in the SYSV INIT system that Red Hat uses that causes
## problems on shutdown when a lockfile doesn't have the same name as
## the initscript that creates it.  This fixes that by changing the
## names of the lockfiles.

# Fix a bug in these initscripts
