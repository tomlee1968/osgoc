centos7:

Problem: The console screen goes into a strange mode (right after
"Reached target Basic System") that I've never seen in any previous
RHEL/CentOS installation.  There is no local echoing of characters,
and line feeds don't include carriage returns.  It apparently makes
the ncurses installation process impossible.  Using cmdline
installation for now.

  Attempt: I've gone into
  /var/www/cobbler/ks_mirror/centos-7.0-x86_64/isolinux/isolinux.cfg
  and added "xdriver=vesa nomodeset" to the append line of the first
  boot option.

  Worked: No apparent effect.

  Attempt: The boot disk runs systemd; I unpacked the initrd.img (an
  xz-compressed cpio archive) and examined it.

  Discovered: The command /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-vconsole-setup is
  what changes the font; it takes settings such as KEYMAP and FONT
  from /etc/vconsole.conf.  But it's not the culprit.  I think so many
  different processes listening on /dev/console (aka /dev/pty/0) is
  the problem -- they conflict with each other and conspire to put the
  terminal into a strange mode.  But you know what?

  Solution: Ctrl+Alt+F2, then chroot /mnt/sysimage.  Use another
  virtual console and the problem goes away.

Problem: In the postinstall script, yum is unable to reach
yum-internal-c7.goc, because it apparently gets an IPv6 address first,
and the server isn't listening on IPv6 -- not to mention the fact that
the system being built isn't using IPv6 either.  Yum seemingly is
unable to fall back to the IPv4 address.  It may be using a libnss
hosts request (like 'getent hosts' does), which seems to always return
an IPv6 address, even though I KNOW there is an IPv4 address in the
LDAP database; I can see it.  Two avenues of attack present
themselves: fix what libnss returns, or make it not matter what libnss
returns.

  Attempt: 'getent ahosts yum-internal-c7.goc' returns both IPv4 and
  IPv6 addresses, so clearly the system is able to deal with this.
  But how can I get yum's invocation of libnss to use 'ahosts' rather
  than 'hosts'?  There doesn't appear to be a way to do that.  I have
  completely turned off IPv6 networking and the problem persists; it
  has to do with what the query returns.

  Worked: No effect.

  Attempt: Configuring yum-internal-c7 to listen on both its IPv4 and
  IPv6 addresses, then attempting to get the stemcell to have both as
  well.  The first part is easy; all addresses exist in DNS already.
  The second part consists of both inducing Anaconda to use IPv6
  addresses and convincing the Cobbler server to respond to DHCPv6
  requests.
