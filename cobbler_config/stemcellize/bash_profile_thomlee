# .bash_profile -- executed only by login shell

# If not login shell, this file doesn't run at all, although .bashrc still
# does.

# Note also that /etc/profile runs before this file does (again, though, only
# if login).

# Normally .bashrc only runs on non-interactive shells, but by default RHEL has
# the user .bash_profile run it, so .bashrc runs on login shells too.  Also,
# /etc/bashrc is normally ignored by bash, but RHEL by default has the user
# .bashrc file source /etc/bashrc.
