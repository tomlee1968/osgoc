# An example Name Service Cache config file.  This file is needed by nscd.
#
# Legal entries are:
#
#	logfile			<file>
#	debug-level		<level>
#	threads			<initial #threads to use>
#	max-threads		<maximum #threads to use>
#	server-user             <user to run server as instead of root>
#		server-user is ignored if nscd is started with -S parameters
#       stat-user               <user who is allowed to request statistics>
#	reload-count		unlimited|<number>
#	paranoia		<yes|no>

	debug-level		0
#	reload-count		5

# Paranoia mode will restart nscd once every <restart-interval> seconds.
# This is useful because after a while (a few months usually), nscd seems
# prone to going into an unresponsive state.  Restarting it every so
# often seems to be the only way to prevent this.
