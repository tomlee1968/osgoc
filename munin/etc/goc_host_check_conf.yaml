# Normally a host that appears in global DNS but not local would be an
# error, but this list specifies hosts for which this is normal. There
# are devices that have only one network interface, attached to the
# public network. There are also VIP addresses for LVS -- typically
# these exist only in public DNS because there's no point in LVS on
# the private network. Also, when hostnames are moving from one IP to
# another, the IU DNS admins usually use "old-" and "new-" prefixes in
# public DNS, because they do not like hostnames with IP addresses
# that nothing is listening on, or IP addresses without hostnames that
# something is listening on. Also sometimes we make an alias in public
# DNS but not in private, as with yum1/2.
